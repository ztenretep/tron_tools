# TronGrid

<p align="justify">
The TRON Mainnet can be accessed using a so-called FULL NODE HTTP API. The related URL to access the API is <a href="https://api.trongrid.io/">https://api.trongrid.io</a>. Calling the url in a browser results in something like <code>{"API version":"v1","Welcome to":"TronGrid v3.4.2"}</code>. To deal with TRON (TRX) in real life, we need the access to the TRON Blockchain via TronGrid.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Using the Python module <code>requests</code>, which can be installed from PyPi, a direct access of the API is possible.
