# Foreword

To automate the staking process a bit, I thought about how to do it from one script. I have defined a heredoc within the script that is used as
a template for a configuration file. If the configuration does not exist, it is written. A single configuration file covers the complete staking
process.

# Freeze Balance

The data is read from the configuration file. Then a control output is made to the screen. Then the data is transferred to the blockchain. Finally,
the result is displayed.

The data in the configuration file must be adapted to the needs of the user.

# Vote Super Representative

The data is read from the configuration file. Then a control output is made to the screen. Then the data is transferred to the blockchain. Finally,
the result is displayed.

The data in the configuration file must be adapted to the needs of the user.
