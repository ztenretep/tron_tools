# Foreword

<p align="justify">To automate the staking process a bit, I thought about how to do it from one script. I have defined a heredoc within the script that is used as
a template for a configuration file. If the configuration does not exist, it is written. A single configuration file covers the complete staking
process.</p>

# Freeze Balance

<p align="justify">The data is read from the configuration file. Then a control output is made to the screen. Then the data is transferred to the blockchain. Finally,
