## Account Overview

<p justify="align>This folder contains a Perl script and a Perl package which works out of 
the box. The access to the TRON blockchain is possible by using GET or POST HTTP requests
of the TRON API. This is done by the Perl package. The Perl script is still organising the 
output into the terminal window.</p>

## To-Do

<p justify="align>Missing are informations about the history of the transaction. I know how 
to get the history of the transaction. A script is implemented. Missing is still parsing the 
JSON data in a pretty form for the account overview.</p>
