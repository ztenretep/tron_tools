## Account Overview

In this section there is a Perl script and the related Perl package, that prints the an account overview for 
a given TRON account to the terminal window. I am using this script for daily checking my TRON account.  

## To-Do

At the end it should be possible to get the needed data e.g. for the 
account from the blockchain within the package. Then single values like
 total, free and frozen balance should be callable. One times get the data 
and then getting the relevant informations will reduce bandwidth usage.
