# Tools for the Tron Blockchain

# Motivation

<p align="justify">I used a wallet that allowed me to do Tron (TRX) staking in the past. Some time ago, the wallet provider disabled this function.
Accordingly, I was looking for a way to do everything necessary from the command line on myself. With 
the <span style="background-color: #808080">tronapi</span> from PyPi I found a Python package
that seems to be useful for testing purposes and more.</p>

## Tron (TRX) Staking

<p align="justify">Tron (TRX) staking works as follows. First step is to freeze an amount of Tron. Next one has to identify an so called 
Super Representative (SR). Afterwards one votes for this SR. That's it in principle. Rewards can be claimed on a daily basis.</p>

## Implemented

<p align="justify">Implemented so far is:</p>

- <p align="justify">Creating Tron accounts.</p>
- <p align="justify">Requesting balance from blockchain.</>
- <p align="justify">Freezing balance for staking.</>
- <p align="justify">Voting for Super Representive.</>
- <p align="justify">Claiming rewards from blockchain.</>
- <p align="justify">Requesting list of Super Representatives and partners.</>
- <p align="justify">Requesting account informations.</p>

## To-Do

<p align="justify">A short script for unfreezing of Tron is missing so far. After first period of 3 days I will write and test unfreezing of my 
Tron balance.</>
