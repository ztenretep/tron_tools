# Tools for the Tron Blockchain

# Motivation

<p align="justify">I used a wallet that allowed me to do Tron (TRX) staking in the past. Some time ago, the wallet provider disabled this function.
Accordingly, I was looking for a way to do everything necessary from the command line on  myself. With the Tron API I found a Python package that seems to be useful for testing purposes.</p>

## Tron (TRX) Staking

<p align="justify">Tron (TRX) staking works as follows. First step is to freeze an amount of Tron. Next one has to identify an so called Superrepresentive (SR). Afterwards on votes for this SR. That's it in principle.</p>
