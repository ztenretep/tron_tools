# Motivation

I am using a wallet which allowed in the past staking of Tron (TRX). A time ago they
disabled this feature. So I am looking for a way to do everything from command line
on my own. With the Tron API I found a Python package which seems to be useful for
testing purposes.

## Tron (TRX) Staking

Tron (TRX) staking works as follows. First step is to freeze an amount of Tron. 
Next one has to identify an so called Superrepresentive (SR). Afterwards on votes
for this SR. That's it in principle.
